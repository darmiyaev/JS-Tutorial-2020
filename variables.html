    <h1>Why learn JS?</h1>
    <p>JS makes it possible to make your website dynamic. <br>
        This means that you can make your website interactive with JS. <br>
    </p>
    <h1>What can JS do?</h1>
    <p>
        This is a question that I asked for many programming languages, and here is a clear list:
        <ol>
            <li>Make websites interactive (buttons, games etc)</li>
            <li>Make games (on websites)</li>
            <li>Make desktop apps (electron)</li>
            <li>It can be used with library's/frameworks etc (react JS, node JS)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Now that we understand why we use JS let's learn it!</p>
    <p>IDE is later don't worry.</p>
    <h1>Variables</h1>
    <p>So what are variables? <br>
        Variables hold <strong>values</strong>. <br>
        Values are just data or information. <br>
        Variables are used a lot in coding and are simple. <br>
        Here is how you use variables in Javascript: <br>
        <code>var x = 0;</code> <br>
        Ok now let's break this down. <br>
        var is telling the computer that we are creating a variable. <br>
        x is the name of the variable (information) <br>
        = is <strong>assigning</strong> a <strong>value</strong>. (= is giving a value to the variable, x)
        0  is the <strong>value</strong> of the variable. <br>
        ; is ending the <strong>statement</strong>, statement is just the line of code.
